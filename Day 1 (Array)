Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

SOLUTION--------
Approach-
One brute force approach is to consider every pair of elements and check if their sum equals the target.
This can be done using nested loops, where the outer loop iterates from the first element to the second-to-last element,
and the inner loop iterates from the next element to the last element. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2)

CODE--->
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int n =nums.length;
        for(int i =0; i<n; i++){
            for (int j=i+1;j<n;j++){
                if(nums[i]+nums[j]==target){
                    return new int []{i,j};
                }
            }
        }

        return new int []{};
    }
}
